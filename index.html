                </h3>
                <p>
                    This year we came to Dragobrat again... Until recently, I didn`t 
                    believe that everything worked out. So we bought tickets at the station.
                    That was a real adventure. We came to station and started find 6 tickets.Only 6.Why it`s a problem?
                    Buut. Here we are!
                    I was too nervous, because of my friends. One girl can`t go on that dates, another one on diffent ones. What to do?
                    I awnted to let things go... Let fate decide! And she was cruel!
                    We decided the dates and they were disgusting. But we didn`t have another variant.
                    And 5 minutes before our leaving, I went to the site and checked for the last time for 
                    a new carriage! Oh,fortune! 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Here I am at home looking through what would be all that are needed, checking the names and times.
                    But I still couldn`t realize that we are going. And in general, there were many nuances in order to
                    spoil our rest: almost everyone caught a cold,didn`t take much pills, the state of health was constantly 
                    not great; the weather wasn`t flying, mountain Stog didn`t work, foggy, strong wind. However we overcame
                    all the difficulties, we managed to relax. And as a resulgt, there is something to remember. A month has 
                    already passed, and I still live in the meantime and those emotions. I fall asleep thinking about 
                    the mountains, and wake up thinking about a cool movement and a real atmosphere.

                </p>
                <p>
                    If you like my story and you want a continuance, stay with me.
                    Now I suggest you look at the coolest photos from the trip!

                                            it is only mountains that beckon me with that sort of painful 
                                            magnetic pull to walk deeper and deeper into their beauty.

                                            Mountains are only a problem when they are bigger than you.
